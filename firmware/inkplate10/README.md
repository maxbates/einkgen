# Inkplate 10 firmware

The sketch that runs on the device. On every wake it joins Wi-Fi, fetches
`manifest.json`, redraws the panel only if the image hash changed, reports
status to the device-status Lambda, then deep-sleeps until the next check.

See the project root [README](../../README.md) for the system overview
(§1 device, §7 manifest, §11 firmware spec).

## Hardware

- [Inkplate 10](https://soldered.com/product/inkplate-10/) — 9.7" e-paper,
  1200×825, 8-level grayscale, ESP32.
- USB-C cable for flashing.
- (Optional) Li-Ion battery (3000 mAh is the Soldered-recommended option).

## Toolchain

Arduino IDE 2.x.

1. **Add Soldered's ESP32 board package** in *Preferences → Additional boards
   manager URLs*:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolderedElectronics/Dasduino-Board-Definitions-for-Arduino-IDE/master/package_Dasduino_Boards_index.json
   ```
   Then *Tools → Board → Boards Manager* and install **"Dasduino Boards"**.

2. **Install libraries** via *Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries*:
   - `Inkplate Arduino library` (by Soldered) — provides the `Inkplate` class.
   - `ArduinoJson` v7.x (by Benoit Blanchon) — manifest + status payload.

   The ESP32 core (which ships `WiFi`, `WiFiClientSecure`, `HTTPClient`,
   `Preferences`) comes with the Dasduino board package above.

## Build & flash

1. `cp secrets.h.example secrets.h` and fill in:
   - `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASS`
   - `MANIFEST_URL` — your CloudFront URL ending in `/current/manifest.json`
   - `DEVICE_STATUS_URL` — the device-status Lambda Function URL
   - `DEVICE_STATUS_TOKEN` — the shared secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager
2. Open `inkplate10.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. *Tools → Board → Dasduino Boards →* **Soldered Inkplate10**.
4. *Tools → Partition Scheme →* **Huge APP (3MB No OTA / 1MB SPIFFS)**. The
   default partition is too small for HTTPS + JSON + image decode.
5. Connect the Inkplate via USB-C. Select the serial port under *Tools → Port*.
6. Click *Upload*. First flash takes ~30 s.
7. Open *Tools → Serial Monitor* at **115200 baud** to watch the boot logs.

## Secrets hygiene

`secrets.h` is gitignored. Never commit Wi-Fi credentials or the device token.
Treat the token like an API key — if it leaks, rotate it in AWS Secrets Manager
and reflash the device.

## Notes / TODOs left for hardware-test pass

- HTTPS cert verification is currently disabled (`setInsecure()`). For v0 the
  threat model in the root README (§16) accepts this — the worst case is
  denial of service. Pin the CloudFront cert before shipping outside a home LAN.
- `display.image.draw(...)` is the Inkplate-Arduino-library API. The root
  README originally specced `display.drawImage(...)`; that name isn't exposed
  by the current library, so the sketch uses `image.draw()`. Confirm on
  hardware that the call returns true and the panel renders.
- `display.readBattery()` returns a `double`; we cast to `float` and linearly
  map 3.3→4.2 V to 0→100 %. Calibrate against the actual cell once it's wired.
- Partition scheme name may vary between Dasduino board package versions.
  If "Huge APP" isn't listed, pick any non-OTA scheme with ≥3 MB app space.
